## About ##

A simple GTK application for performing ABX testing using python3 and gstreamer.

## Requirements ##

  * python3
  * GTK3
  * gstreamer (And various good, bad, and ugly modules as needed)
  * python-gtk
  * python-gst

## Current Features ##

  * Swap A/B on at any point while playing
  * Perform any number of tests and show/hide results at any time

## Usage / Installation ##

1. run abx.py

    ```bash
    ./abx.py
    ```
2. Select files for A and B

3. Play A,B,X and make make your guesses

4. "Show" to show results
